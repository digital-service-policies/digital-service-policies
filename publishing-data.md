# Publishing Data

## Introduction

Many times we need to make data available to others either through our own
services or the services and platforms of others. This policy provides some
bullet points for consideration when publishing data online meant to be 
consumed by many others for a variety of purposes.

## Legal

### Clearly Indicate The License And Terms Data Is Made Available Under

When the ownership, rights and terms of agreement data is made available under
are not clear, so is the legal risk to using the data. Use of data without
permission can lead to lawsuits or even criminal action in some cases, therefore
more cautious users are likely to be discouraged. Clearly indicating the 
license and terms you make data available under reduces friction for others
wanting to use your data.

### Indicate Terms Data As Close As Possible To The Location Data Is Accessed

Users of your data are unlikely to be happy having to browse your entire site
to discover if they can use your data or not. Put license information and terms
near download links or clearly indicate where to find them near those points
instead.

## Formats

### Prefer Open Formats

Avoid proprietary formats such as .doc or .ai when publishing data meant for
mass consumption. These formats often require proprietary software that not 
everyone may have access to. Even when they are supported by freely available
software, support may not be as extensive or may even be buggy.

### Avoid Publishing Statistical Data In Non-Machine Readable Format

Often people desire statistical data to conduct their own analysis via software
of their own choosing. The harder it is for users to transfer your data into 
their own systems, the less likely they are to use it.
