# Digital Service Policies

A collection of policies and guidelines developed with the aim to improve the 
quality of digital services in Trinidad and Tobago.

## About

The adoption of digital technology for the provision of services in Trinidad
and Tobago may be best described as; unfortunate. While both the private and 
public sectors have increased their digital offerings in recent years 
(circa 2010-2021) the number of services is far below what one might expect
for a nation of our wealth.

Furthermore, many times the quality of these services fall far below the basic 
reasonable expectations of the average citizen. Anyone working in software 
development long enough knows this stuff is hard, worse yet when you don't have
anything to reference and measure your success by.

This project aims to ease that burden and hopefully contribute to an increase
in the quality of digital services by documenting and offering community
reviewed guidelines that new and existing projects can benefit from.

## Contributing

The project is laid out as a series of markdown files each addressing a
particular need or interest. Each file represents its own policy. If you
would like to add a policy, create a new file and structure it similar to 
the existing ones.

Once you are satisfied with your first draft, create a pull request where
the policy will be discussed, edited and eventually merged if all goes well.

If you spot an error or would like to amend and existing policy, please
use the Github issue tracker.
